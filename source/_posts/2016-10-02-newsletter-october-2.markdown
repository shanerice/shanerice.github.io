It's Sunday night and like every self-respecting dad in his late 30's in early fall, I'm watching Saturday Night Live on Hulu as I write this week's update.

This week's update is going to be to the point. I'm not feeling great, there's a tiny snot troll sitting inside my head pushing yellow and green stuff around.

## Google announced a free version of their Optimize tool.
Google launched Optimize 360 back in March for companies using Google Analytics 360. Optimize powers A/B tests for websites, just like Optimizely or Visual Web Optimizer.

This might have been on your radar, but Analytics 360 is an enterprise tool with a big price tag. Until this week when [Google announced they are releasing a free version of Optimize](https://analytics.googleblog.com/2016/09/announcing-smart-fast-acting-analytics-for-everyone.html).

Optimize joins DataStudio in beta to compliment Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics.

## AdWords retargeting launches across devices
Facebook has offered cross device retargeting for a long time now, and [Google announced this week they'll be adding the same ability to Google Display Network and DoubleClick Bid Manager](http://marketingland.com/google-cross-device-remarketing-launches-192819).

This means you can use AdWords to deliver retargeted ads via Google Display Network. Which is nice, but if you don't have time or bandwidth to design the banners you might want to look at retargeting on Facebook.

## Gmail (finally) goes responsive
And in the final piece of Google news this week, Litmus reported that [Gmail will start supporting embedded styles and responsive design](https://litmus.com/blog/gmail-to-support-responsive-email-design).

It's really interesting to see big mailbox providers like Outlook/Live/Hotmail and Gmail starting to listen to long-time gripes many designers and marketers have had about how their platforms display email.

Here's hoping the trend continues.

## Twitter launches moments for everyone
Sharing a conversation from Twitter can be a pain in the ass, which is why it's nice to see [Twitter release Moments for everyone](https://twitter.com/i/moments/780516658917933056).

Twitter is catching a lot of shit, and it's all well-earned, but I love it and it makes me happy to see them putting out useful things we can all use.

## South Park celebrates 20 years with mobile billboards
South Park has been on the air for 20 years now, and this week they celebrated by sending mobile billboards across the country.

[Instead of sending them rolling around cities, they parked them in front of the Church of Scientology HQ, the Lincoln Memorial, and the White House](http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-south-park-drove-these-mobile-billboards-places-they-werent-wanted-173799).

## Uber driver delivers cable boxes
Love What Matters shared a story from a guy from Brooklyn who needed to return some equipment to his cable company. He called an Uber and when the driver arrived and saw the equipment he offered to deliver it for the guy.

He was kind of floored and let the guy take the equipment. The Uber driver only charged him for the trip out and it saved him $20 off his trip.

[The entire story is worth a read](https://www.facebook.com/lovewhatreallymatters/photos/a.710462625642805.1073741828.691679627521105/1256021827753546/?type=3&theater) and it's a great reminder of how a little thought creates a unique experience people will remember.
