<div class="entry-content"><p>What a weekend! My daughter&rsquo;s birthday is today, and I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how the way I talk about this event online has changed over the years. When she was born, I posted pics on Facebook and shared all the details. I remember thinking, &ldquo;How cool is this? I can let so many people know right away she&rsquo;s here and everything is good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I shared more and more over time, until she started getting older and it dawned on me I might be sharing stuff she&rsquo;d read, or see, about herself in the future. Maybe I&rsquo;m being too cautious, but if Facebook sticks around I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they create a feature to change the privacy settings for posts about our kids in the next few years.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to this week&rsquo;s marketing news.</p>

<h2>Snapchat ad API getting some press</h2>

<p>A couple of weeks ago Snapchat launched a new playlist features for stories, you click on stories from people you follow and hit play. Then those stories are played back in the order you chose. This allows advertisers to insert ads between spots while you watch the stories of accounts you follow.</p>

<p>This change can be managed through an ads interface Snapchat released this summer, and <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/heres-how-brands-are-cashing-snapchats-long-awaited-api-174056">AdWeek has an interesting story featuring Gary Vaynerchuk talking about how VaynerMedia is helping companies A/B test and improve their ads on Snapchat</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Snapchat Extra:</strong> I&rsquo;m a big fan of Disney and <a href="http://comicbook.com/2016/10/22/disney-and-lacma-team-up-to-retell-beauty-and-the-beast-using-sn/">comicbook.com</a> reported a partnership between Disney and the LA County Museum of Art. The <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/add/lacma">LACMA</a> and <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/add/ohmydisney">OhMyDisney</a> Snap accounts will be retelling classic Disney movies together on a bi-monthly basis.</p>

<h2>Two things from the campaign trail</h2>

<p>During Wednesday night&rsquo;s debate <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/19/technology/excedrin-debate-tweet/">Excedrin rode the #DebateHeadache hashtag</a> to the top of Twitter&rsquo;s Trending Topics and a ton of mentions in other media. Usually when you see these stories it&rsquo;s about how a big company jumped on an real-time opportunity to grab attention like this, but those posts go viral on their own.</p>

<p>So it ends up being a crapshoot. But Excedrin&rsquo;s tweet was promoted, and I&rsquo;d bet this is something they cooked up over a few days at least. It&rsquo;s clever, and it builds on Excederin&rsquo;s advertising, but it didn&rsquo;t take the quickest wits or require them to be first to post.</p>

<p>I love it! One more brick on the scale pushing people to pick up Excederin when they have a headache.</p>

<p>The other campaign story I loved this week was <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/hillary-trolls-trump-raises-money-each-time-he-tweets/">Hillary for America releasing a Troll Trump fundraising bot</a>. Visitors can pledge to donate a set amount each time @DonaldJTrump tweets, with a set daily limit.</p>

<p>This story feels kind of dicey, but I want y'all to know I&rsquo;m not sharing it for a political guffaw or two. It&rsquo;s pretty genius to create per action campaigns to draw attention to your platform. It could be simple like &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give 10,000 credits every week for the best Tweet about <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/hillary-trolls-trump-raises-money-each-time-he-tweets/">Postmark</a>&rdquo;(shameless plug for Wildbit &lt;3) or some other way to engage your audience and grow your business.</p>

<h2>ProPublica slams Google for combining DoubleClick database</h2>

<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking">ProPublica released a report about Google combining their advertising database with DoubleClick</a>. In the past, Google kept data generated through their flagship products separate from DoubleClick data. This is a concession they made to the FTC over a privacy uproar when they bought DoubleClick.</p>

<p>Google made this change over the summer with an opt-in announcement through Google accounts. Their wording was vague, which ProPublica points out in their article.</p>

<p>This move is definitely about giving Google a chance at competing with Facebook for retargeting and interest targeting. The big difference to me is that Facebook doesn&rsquo;t have anything I&rsquo;m not consciously sharing with them. Google has a trove of search and email information that I don&rsquo;t really want advertisers using to target me. It&rsquo;s all led me to start looking for paid alternatives for my personal email accounts.</p>

<h2>Pinterest launches Pin Collective</h2>

<p><a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en/blog/introducing-pin-collective-group-expert-pinterest-creators">Pin Collective is a new ad partner program from Pinterest to connect advertisers with their top creators</a>. This comes a week after Pinterest announced they are on pace to triple revenue to $300 million this year. Their partners include publishers, production shops, independent creators, who&rsquo;ll join Pinterest&rsquo;s internal Pin Factory program to help advertisers create promoted pins to capture attention from their target audience.</p>

<h2>eSports are the future</h2>

<p>ESPN has been broadcasting eSport events for the last couple of years. The first one I remembering watching was a college competition using a game from ActivisionBlizzard called Heroes of the Dorm.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because it feels like a joke to anyone my age who grew up playing the NES or Civ II. <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/09/the-esports-industry-is-about-to-boom-advertisers-want-in.html">Then you read reports that the total eSports market is going to be $916 million by the end of 2016</a>.</p>

<p>The laughing stops right about there.</p>

<p>Activision&rsquo;s CEO was in the news this week when he announced ActivisionBlizzard has 500 million active monthly users in 196 countries. That&rsquo;s more active monthly users than Netflix. Five times more. If your audience plays video games, eSports is something to keep an eye on.</p>
