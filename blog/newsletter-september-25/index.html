<div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, campers, rise and shine, don&rsquo;t forget to read AmpKnob this week!</p>

<p>I took a big part of this week off to enjoy Walt Disney World with the family, but getting home on Sunday night gives me plenty of time to get this to your inbox for Monday morning.</p>

<p>Do you want to keep getting this delivered on Sunday night for you to read on Monday morning? Email newsletters normally get sent after the crush of the Monday morning inbox, but since this newsletter should have tidbits you can fit into your work for the week it makes sense to send it now.</p>

<p>If you want it at a different time, can you send me an email? I can setup some personalization for delivery times, but I don&rsquo;t want to spend time doing that if no one is interested.</p>

<p>Now, on to the news.</p>

<h2>People remember branded content when they forget ads</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ipglab.com/2016/09/23/ipg-media-lab-forbes-evaluate-the-current-state-of-branded-content/">IPG MediaLab released a study this week showing people recall branded content 59% more than other display ads</a>. The results are similar to a study from 2013.</p>

<p>This is kind of incredible stuff.</p>

<p>We should all be thinking through ways to pay to have our best content setup as branded content in the right publications.</p>

<h2>Egg all over Facebook for video metric error</h2>

<p>Facebook announced an error in one of their video metrics this week. If you saw this story at all, the headlines discussed it with breathless headlines.</p>

<p>Businessweek said, &ldquo;Facebook says it gave advertisers inflated video metrics!&rdquo;</p>

<p>David Fischer, from Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fischer/posts/10157497355045187">shared a post where he clarified exactly what Facebook miscalculated</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;About a month ago, we found an error in the way we calculate one of the video metrics on our dashboard – average duration of video viewed. The metric should have reflected the total time spent watching a video divided by the total number of people who played the video. But it didn’t – it reflected the total time spent watching a video divided by only the number of “views” of a video (that is, when the video was watched for three or more seconds). And so the miscalculation overstated this metric. While this is only one of the many metrics marketers look at, we take any mistake seriously.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Facebook video ads are super cheap, somewhere around $.01 for many advertisers, so I&rsquo;d take this story with a grain of salt and continue to experiment with Facebook ads.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t go spending your entire marketing budget on Facebook, but test to see if you can find a cheap method to get in front of your target audience.</p>

<h2>Media links don&rsquo;t count against character limits on Twitter now</h2>

<p>While we&rsquo;re talking about social media stories, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/express-even-more-in-140-characters">back in May Twitter announced</a> they&rsquo;d stop counting media links against the character limit for tweets.</p>

<p>This feature has fully rolled out now. This doesn&rsquo;t extend the limit for links to posts outside of Twitter, but does change the rules for Retweets so you can RT a reply to all of your followers instead of using &lsquo;.@&rsquo; to broadcast.</p>

<h2>Reflik geohacks TechCrunch Disrupt. TechCrunch is pissed!</h2>

<p>This story made me laugh pretty hard.</p>

<p>TechCrunch Disrupt was in SF. In the immortal words of Fred Armisen as Joy Behar, &ldquo;So what? Who cares?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, Reflik snapped up a Snapchat geofilter to cover the spot where the event was being held for $58. So, attendees who paid $2,995 per ticket were getting hit with an ad for a product they could use on Snapchat for peanuts.</p>

<p>A TechCrunch writer took to his keyboard to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/23/the-biggest-problem-with-snapchats-geofilter-product/">call for Snapchat to open up a bidding system for their geofilters</a>. It all read as a bit of sour grapes on the part of TechCrunch, and I frankly loved the hustle of Reflik figuring out how to get the word out on the cheap.</p>

<h2>Spotify and Tinder team up to power matches</h2>

<p><a href="https://news.spotify.com/us/2016/09/20/spotify-partners-with-tinder-to-swipe-up-the-volume/">Spotify announced they&rsquo;re going to help people decide if they want to connect on Tinder</a>. Once they opt-in, folks using Tinder can now see artists you have in common, pick an &lsquo;Anthem&rsquo; to share on Tinder, and view other people&rsquo;s Anthems on their profile.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about this announcement is Spotify is spreading their data out to other apps to make interesting connections based on listening habits. There&rsquo;s a ton of untapped potential for music preferences and apps to crossover and provide a better experience to both sets of users.</p>

<h2>Share AmpKnob?</h2>

<p>This is the end of the second week of the AmpKnob newsletter. Have the last two weeks helped you keep up with marketing news you might&rsquo;ve missed without it?</p>

<p>If it has, it&rsquo;d mean the world to me if you could share it with your friends on Twitter or Facebook. I&rsquo;m going to keep the goodness coming, and have a few special projects you&rsquo;ll hear more about over the next couple of months.</p>
